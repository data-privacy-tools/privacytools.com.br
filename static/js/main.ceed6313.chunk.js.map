Please read the Agreement carefully. To confirm your understanding and acceptance of the Agreement, click “Agree.”</p> <p>A. INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES</p> <p>This Agreement governs your use of Apple’s services (“Services”), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, apps (“Apps”), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”). Content may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your country of residence (“Home Country”). To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply). Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.</p> <p>B. USING OUR SERVICES</p> <p>PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS</p> <p>You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International and you acquire an App or a book, Apple Distribution International is the merchant of record; this means that you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International, and it is licensed by the App Provider (as defined below) or book publisher. When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions. If you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions:\n                     <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204030\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204030</a>. Apple will charge your selected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes. If you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay. If we cannot charge your selected payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method again as you may update your payment method information. If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability). In accordance with local law, Apple may update information regarding your selected payment method if provided such information by your financial institution. For details about how Transactions are billed, please visit <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5582\">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5582</a>. All Transactions are final. Content prices may change at any time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple. From time to time, Apple may refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim. Terms related to Store Credit and gift cards/codes are available here: <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/\">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/</a>.</p> <p>APPLE ID</p> <p>Using our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID. An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem. Your Apple ID is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security. Apple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your Apple ID. Please contact Apple if you suspect that your Apple ID has been compromised.</p> <p>You must be age 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the registration process) to create an Apple ID and use our Services. Apple IDs for persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution.</p> <p>PRIVACY</p> <p>Your use of our Services is subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy, which is available at <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/\">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>.</p> <p>SERVICES AND CONTENT USAGE RULES</p> <p>Your use of the Services and Content must follow the rules set forth in this section (“Usage Rules”). Any other use of the Services and Content is a material breach of this Agreement.

We encourage you to back up your Content regularly.</p> <p>- You may not tamper with or circumvent any security technology included with the Services.</p> <p>- You may access our Services only using Apple’s software, and may not modify or use modified versions of such software.</p> <p>- Video Content requires an HDCP connection.</p> <p>Audio and Video Content Sales and Rentals:</p> <p>- You can use Digital Rights Management (DRM)-free Content on a reasonable number of compatible devices that you own or control. DRM-protected Content can be used on up to five computers and any number of devices that you sync to from those computers.</p> <p>- Content rentals are viewable on a single device at a time, and must be played within 30 days, and completed within 48 hours of the start of play (stopping, pausing or restarting does not extend this period).</p> <p>- You may burn an audio playlist of purchased music to disc for listening purposes up to seven times; this limitation does not apply to DRM-free Content.&nbsp; Other Content may not be burned to disc.</p> <p>App Store Content:</p> <p>- The term “App” includes apps for any Apple platform and/or operating system, in-app purchases, extensions (such as keyboards), stickers, and subscriptions made available in an app.</p> <p>- You can use Apps on any device that you own or control.</p> <p>- Individuals acting on behalf of a commercial enterprise, governmental organization or educational institution (an “Enterprise”) may download and sync non-Arcade Apps for use by either (i) a single individual on one or more devices owned or controlled by an Enterprise; or (ii) multiple individuals on a single shared device owned or controlled by an Enterprise. For the sake of clarity, each device used serially or collectively by multiple users requires a separate license.</p> <p>Apple Music:</p> <p>- You can use an Individual Apple Music membership on up to 10 devices (only five of which can be computers).</p> <p>- An Individual Apple Music membership allows you to stream on a single device at a time; a Family membership allows you or your Family members to stream on up to six devices at a time.</p> <p>Apple Arcade:</p> <p>- Apple Arcade Apps may only be downloaded, or redownloaded, with a valid Apple Arcade trial or subscription.</p> <p>- If your subscription ends, Apps downloaded via Apple Arcade will no longer be accessible to you.</p> <p>Apple TV Content</p> <p>- For most channels, you can stream Content on up to three devices simultaneously.&nbsp;</p> <p>- You may be limited in the amount of Content you may download, and some downloaded Content may expire after a given amount of time after downloaded or first played. Certain Content may not be available for download at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>- Learn more about Apple TV Content Usage Rules at <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210074\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210074</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>REDOWNLOADS</p> <p>You may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (“Redownload”) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (“Associated Devices”). You can see Content types available for Redownload in your Home Country at <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204632\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204632</a>. Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.</p> <p>Associated Devices Rules (except Apple Arcade):&nbsp; You can have up to 10 devices (but only a maximum of 5 computers) signed in with your Apple ID at one time. Each computer must also be authorized using the same Apple ID (to learn more about authorization of computers, visit <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201251\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201251</a>). Devices can be associated with a different Apple ID once every 90 days.</p> <p>Associated Devices Rules for Apple Arcade:&nbsp; You can have up to 10 devices signed in to Apple Arcade per Family member at one time.&nbsp; Devices can be associated with a different Apple ID once every 90 days.</p> <p>SUBSCRIPTIONS</p> <p>The Services and certain Apps may allow you to purchase access to Content or services on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”). Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions,\n                visit <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039</a>. We will notify you if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, seek your consent to continue. You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period.&nbsp; We reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription.&nbsp; Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the free trial ends.</p> <p>CONTENT AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY</p> <p>Terms found in this Agreement that relate to Services, Content types, features or functionality not available in your Home Country are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you. To see the Content types available to you in your Home Country, go to the Services or visit <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411</a>. Certain Services and Content available to you in your Home Country may not be available to you when traveling outside of your Home Country.</p> <p>NON-APPLE DEVICES</p> <p>If you use our Services on a non-Apple-branded device, you may not be able to access all features or Content types. Terms in this Agreement relating to unavailable features or Content types are not applicable to you. If you later choose to access our Services from an Apple-branded device, you agree that all terms of this Agreement will apply to your use on such device.</p> <p>C. YOUR SUBMISSIONS TO OUR SERVICES</p> <p>Our Services may allow you to submit materials such as comments, pictures, videos, and podcasts (including associated metadata and artwork). Your use of such features must comply with the Submissions Guidelines below, which may be updated from time to time. If you see materials that do not comply with the Submissions Guidelines, please use the Report a Concern feature. You hereby grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the materials you submit within the Services and related marketing, and Apple internal purposes. Apple may monitor and decide to remove or edit any submitted material.</p> <p>Submissions Guidelines: You may not use the Services to:</p> <p>- post any materials that you do not have permission, right or license to use;</p> <p>- post objectionable, offensive, unlawful, deceptive or harmful content;</p> <p>- post personal, private or confidential information belonging to others;</p> <p>- request personal information from a minor;</p>\n                <p>- impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with another person, or entity;</p> <p>- post or transmit spam, including but not limited to unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or informational announcements;</p> <p>- plan or engage in any illegal, fraudulent, or manipulative activity.</p> <p>D. FAMILY SHARING</p> <p>The organizer of a Family (“Organizer”) must be 18 years or older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13 or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country (as set forth in the registration process). Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features.</p> <p>Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows you to share eligible Content among up to six members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer's payment method is used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s payment method is used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions, and (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contract, and assume all risk related to sharing access to the payment method with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and the Organizer. &nbsp;</p> <p>Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a convenient feature that allows an Organizer to approve each Transaction initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country). The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Content downloaded from Family members or acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy.</p> <p>Family Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member’s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer’s payment method.</p> <p>Family Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing.&nbsp; Apple Arcade and Apple News+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Purchase Sharing.&nbsp; Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.</p> <p>E. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION FEATURES</p> <p>The Services may recommend Content to you based on your downloads, purchases and other activities. You may opt out from receiving such personalized recommendations for some Services in your account settings.</p> <p>Some recommendation features may require your permission before they are turned on. If you turn on these features, you will be asked to give Apple permission to collect and store certain data, including but not limited to data about your device activity, location, and usage. Please carefully read the information presented when you turn on these features.</p> <p>F. ADDITIONAL ITUNES STORE TERMS</p> <p>SEASON PASS AND MULTI-PASS</p> <p>A Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available. A Season Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per season; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Season Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Season Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If automatic renewal is selected when you obtain a Multi-Pass, you will be charged the full price of each subsequent Multi-Pass cycle. You can turn off automatic renewal at least 24 hours prior to the beginning of the next Multi-Pass cycle in your account settings. If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple.</p> <p>G. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS)</p> <p>LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT&nbsp;</p> <p>App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”). If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International, the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International, which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International, but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.</p> <p>IN-APP PURCHASES</p> <p>Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”). In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you’ve asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304\">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304</a>.</p> <p>APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT</p> <p>Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.</p> <p>APP BUNDLES</p> <p>Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.</p> <p>LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</p> <p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.</p> <p>a. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).</p> <p>b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals -\n                    that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p> <p>c. Termination. This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.</p> <p>d. External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, \"External Services\"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.</p> <p>e. NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p> <p>f. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.</p> <p>i. Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Agreement and the relationship between you and Apple shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You and Apple agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement.

ADDITIONAL APPLE BOOKS TERMS</p> <p>You acquire Apple Books Content from the third-party provider of such Content (the “Publisher”), not Apple. Apple acts as an agent for the Publisher in providing Apple Books Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Publisher. If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International, the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International, which means that you acquire a license to use the Content from Apple Distribution International, but the Content is licensed by the Publisher. The Publisher of the Apple Books Content reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Apple Books Content. The Publisher of the Apple Books Content is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.</p> <p>I. ADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS</p> <p>APPLE MUSIC MEMBERSHIP</p> <p>Apple Music is a subscription music service. Your Apple Music membership will automatically renew until you cancel in account settings. See the “Subscriptions” section for more details. When your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to any feature of Apple Music that requires a membership, including but not limited to access to Apple Music songs stored on your device, and iCloud Music Library.</p> <p>Where available, you may be offered an Apple Music membership through your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”). If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier will bill you for the cost of your Apple Music membership. Your billing relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple. By using Apple Music, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.</p> <p>ICLOUD MUSIC LIBRARY</p> <p>iCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or a third party (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices. iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content. This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music.\n                     iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store or Apple Music do not count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use, and the time and duration of playback. You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content. iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library. If you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which is subject to the terms set forth in this section.</p> <p>J. ADDITIONAL APPLE ARCADE TERMS</p> <p>APPLE ARCADE SUBSCRIPTION</p> <p>Apple Arcade is a game subscription service. Your Apple Arcade subscription will automatically renew until you cancel in account settings. See the “Subscriptions” section for more details. When your Apple Arcade subscription ends, you will lose access to any functionality of Apple Arcade that requires a subscription, including but not limited to access to apps downloaded from Apple Arcade that are stored on your device.</p> <p>K.
